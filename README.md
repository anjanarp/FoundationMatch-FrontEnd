# FoundationMatch-FrontEnd
The questionare in this repository is the alpha version of the questionare from the 66Foundation-Match project. It also contains a Vision AI script that can extrapolate dominant image properties from a local file. The front-end and back-end was connected and modified to use OpenCV libraries for skin tone segmentation in 66Foundation-Match.
